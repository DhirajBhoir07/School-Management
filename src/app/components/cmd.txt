git tag <tag name>
git tag
git tag <tag name> <commit hash>  // attatch tag name with commit hash code
git tag -d <tag name>       // delete tag

// Rebase or Reflog
REBASE :- Git rebase is a powerful Git feature used to change the base of a branch.
          It effectively allows you to move a branch to a new starting point, 
        @ DON'T DO IT ON THE MAIN BRANCH ... DO IT ON THE BRANCH THAT YOU WANT TO REBASE.

like we have new branch called feature-b 
we add somthing in feature-b so now you -b branch is ahead of main branch then
we add something in the main branch then main branch is ahead now since the main branch ahead of 
one commit we want it to rebase to have the -b 
so we checkout feature-b then we use the cmd - git rebase master ...... Head -> feature-b

Git reflog :

Git reflog is a command that shows you the history of your commits.
It allows you to see the changes that you have made to your repository over time. 
This can be useful for debugging and understanding the history of your project.

git reflog  // gives you the history

Remote URL Setting
You can check the remote url setting by running the following command:
git remote -v

git remote add origin https://github.com/DhirajBhoir07/Learning_Practice.git

# IF YOU WANT TO REMOVE IT 
git remote remove origin

# GENERATE THE SSH KEY 
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "dhirajbhoir200@gmail.com"

  ADD TO SSH
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519   // ADDED THE SSH INTO THE SYSTEM

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub   // YOU WILL GET THE KEY

before pushing i checkout whether remote -v .. is there or not then

ssh -T git@github.com   // accept yes,... it will be say "..successfully.."
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:DhirajBhoir07/School-Management.git
git push origin main


git push -u origin main   // THIS SETS THE UPSTREAM , so every time you don't need to write the 
"git push origin main" instead just "git push"
so this will remember the thing that you want to push it one remote "origin" main branch
